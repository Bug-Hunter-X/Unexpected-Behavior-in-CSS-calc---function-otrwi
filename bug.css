The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be unexpected behavior if spaces are not used correctly in the calculation. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` will likely result in an error, while `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works correctly.  Another common mistake is trying to use `calc()` with units that don't mix, for example `calc(100px + 2em)` is fine, but `calc(100% + 2em)` might cause problems depending on the context.
